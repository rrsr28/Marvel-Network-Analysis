## ðŸ“– Overview

This project explores the Marvel superhero universes through the lens of **graph theory**. Using Python, Pandas, and NetworkX, we model characters, teams, and affiliations as nodes and edges in a graph. The notebook also includes traditional EDA and visualizations to complement the graph-based analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Load and clean a superhero dataset
- Visualize character distributions (by gender, publisher, etc.)
- Construct an undirected graph of superheroes based on team affiliations
- Analyze the graph using:
  - Node degree distribution
  - Connected components
  - Clustering and path analysis
- Visualize the superhero universe as a network

## ðŸ§© Why Graph Theory?

Superhero universes are complex networks of alliances, teams, publishers, and rivalries. Representing this data as a graph allows us to:
- Identify hubs (popular characters)
- Explore community structure (teams, affiliations)
- Analyze connectivity (universe fragmentation, centrality)
